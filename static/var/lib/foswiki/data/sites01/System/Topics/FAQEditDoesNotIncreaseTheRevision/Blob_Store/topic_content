The same topic revision will be used when you save a topic again within a certain time frame (one hour by default, configurable with configure item ={ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin}=). This is to prevent unnecessary topic revisions when you do several edit cycles in a row. Note that a new revision *is* created if another person edits the same topic, regardless of the time.

[[System.PatternSkin.TOPICKEY]] offers the ability to [[System.ForceNewRevision.TOPICKEY][force a new revision]] during save.
